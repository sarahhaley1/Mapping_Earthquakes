# Mapping_Earthquakes


### Purpose 
The purpose of the mapping earthqaukes project is to visually show the difference between the magnitudes of earthquakes in the past seven days all over the world.

### Tasks Completed
To complete this project, a URL URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website was used to retrieve geographical coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then the data found was added to a map.

### Approach
The approach taken for this project:
- use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
- use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
